The software is developed in the ROME framework and allows to manager the simulation tools
for the Gas Monitored Chamber. It does not include the Geant4 MC which is now an external 
package. Nevertheless it needs as input a file.root created by Geant4.  

The main tools of GMCAnalyzer are:

 -- Creation of the hits in the chamber and external pixel tracker
 
 -- Simulation of the waveforms in the drift chamber
 
 -- Reconstruction of the particle tracks

========================
To install the software
========================
  1) Set the enviroment variables by the file envDeps_csh or envDeps_sh
     (check the right path for LD_LIBRARY_PATH that should include the path for MonteCarlo lib and midas lib)
     
  2) Compile the source code typing the command
     $ROMESYS/bin/romebuilder.exe -i GMC.xml -midas
     
 
====================
To use the software
====================
  1) Check if MCData00001.root is present in home directory
  (NOTE: it is the Geant4 output file: if this file is not present there, you need to run Geant4 MC
  
  2) Run the GMCAnalyzer by command
     ./gmcanalyzer.exe -i geant4MC.xml -r 1 -e 1-100
     
     In the configuration file geant4MC.xml two tasks are active:
      -- ReadMCData that reads MonteCarlo data and creates hits in the both subdetectors.
         Moreover it creates the clusters along the particle trajectory in the drift chamber .
         
      -- GenerateWaveform: this task simulates the signal generated on the sense wires for drift chamber.
      
     All data information is stored in MCHits#.root. Three active branches:
      i)   DCHits  which contains the hits and clusters data for each tracker tube
      ii)  PXHits  which contains the data coming out from the pixel detector
      iii) DCWaveform  where the waveforms related to the hits are stored 
      
     Is possible to switch on or off a task editing the geant4MC.xml file and changing the its status in <Task> section.
     
   3) Run the reconstruction
     ./gmcanalyzer.exe -i recoMC.xml -r 1 -e 1-100
     
     Based on the TMinuit tool, the task performs the event reconstruction. Each track is recontructed in
     two step:
      a) taking advantage of pixel detector estimates the initial track parameters (vertex and direction)
      b) calling TMinuit to reconstruct the track in drift chamber
      
     The recontruction data are stored in RecoData.root
     Now this file contains only the branch related to the reconstructed tracks. The branches for hits in
     drift chamber and pixel detector are not active.  
 
==============
Event display
==============
A simple event display has been developed which shows the tracks coming from Geant4 MC.
It is possible to switch on the event display changing the tag <ProgramMode> in the .xml configuration file.
